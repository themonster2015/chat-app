This is a very basic chat room built on NodeJS
If you already have NodeJS installed with express and socket.io module added, you can run the following command to start the app:
$ node index

Then point your browser to http://localhost:3000. Optionally, specify a port by supplying the PORT env variable.

The app is also available live online at https://warm-mesa-54600.herokuapp.com/

Enjoy!
